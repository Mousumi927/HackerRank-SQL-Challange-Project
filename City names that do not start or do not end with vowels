Query the list of CITY names from STATION that either do not start with vowels or do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

Solution:

Select DISTINCT city from STATION 
where  (CITY NOT LIKE 'a%'
        AND CITY  NOT LIKE 'e%'
        AND CITY NOT LIKE 'i%' 
        AND CITY NOT LIKE 'o%'
        AND CITY NOT LIKE 'u%')
OR (CITY NOT LIKE '%a' 
    AND CITY  NOT LIKE '%e' 
    AND CITY NOT LIKE '%i'  
    AND CITY NOT LIKE '%o'  
    AND CITY NOT LIKE '%u');
