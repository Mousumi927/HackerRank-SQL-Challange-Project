Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to 4 decimal places.

Solution:

SET @row := 0;
SET @count = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Station);

select ROUND(stn1.LAT_N, 4) from Station stn1
inner join
(SELECT @row := @row + 1 As 'Rank', stnRowNum.*
FROM Station stnRowNum order by stnRowNum.LAT_N ) stn2
ON stn1.Id = stn2.id and stn2.Rank = ROUND(@count/2);
